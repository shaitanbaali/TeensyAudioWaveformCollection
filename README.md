Teensy Audio AKWF Waveform Collection
====================

Waveform collection for Teensy Audio Library converted from 
Adventure Kid Waveforms (AKWF) Open library using 
Wolfram Mathematica 12:

Code:
```Mathematica
Flatten[Floor[32768 Import["File.wav", "Data", SampleRate -> 18816]]]
```

The notebook for Mathematica is in the tools folder. 

Features:

* 4358 waveforms with a visual index guide and the original WAV 16 bit 44.1 kHz file 
* A 256 samples long Arduino H waveform library for each waveform ready for use with Teensy Audio Library. 
* 16 bit, 44.1 kHz streaming audio is generated by interpolation on Teensy Audio library.
* One instrument can import and use multiple waveforms as supported by Teensy Audio library.
